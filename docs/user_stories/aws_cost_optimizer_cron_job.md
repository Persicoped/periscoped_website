# User Story: Automated AWS Cost Optimization Recommendations

## User Story
**As a** business owner managing AWS infrastructure costs  
**I want** an automated monthly report that analyzes my AWS spending and identifies services I can safely disable  
**So that** I can optimize costs without manually reviewing billing data each month

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given
- I have an active AWS account with multiple services running
- I have email configured on my local machine
- Cron job is set up to run on the 2nd of each month

### When  
- The cron job executes on the 2nd day of each month
- The script analyzes the previous month's AWS Cost Explorer data
- The script categorizes services as "Essential" vs "Optional" for SAAS operations

### Then
- I receive an email with:
  - Total monthly AWS spend breakdown by service
  - List of "High Impact Removals" (services costing >$5/month that can be safely disabled)
  - Estimated monthly and annual savings if services are disabled
  - Services categorized as essential for core SAAS platform operations
- Email includes actionable recommendations with cost impact
- Email is sent to my configured email address

## Technical Requirements
- Cron job scheduled for 2nd of each month at 9 AM
- Uses AWS CLI and Cost Explorer API
- Email sent via local mail system (sendmail/postfix)
- Script handles AWS authentication via stored credentials
- Error handling for API failures with fallback notification

## Definition of Done
- Cron job successfully runs monthly without manual intervention
- Email contains accurate cost data and actionable recommendations
- Services are correctly categorized as essential vs optional
- Cost savings calculations are accurate
- Script logs execution for debugging

# Periscoped.io Website Integrations

This directory contains all third-party service integrations, user stories, and configuration documentation for the Periscoped.io website.

## Integration Strategy

The website follows a modular integration approach, where each service integration is:
- Self-contained with its own documentation
- Independently configurable
- Following security best practices
- Properly tested and validated

## Current Integrations

### Google Workspace (`google_workspace/`)
- Gmail API for email sending
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Future: Drive, Calendar, Analytics

### Planned Integrations

- **AWS Services** - SES, S3, Lambda integration
- **Stripe** - Payment processing for future paid services
- **Slack** - Team notifications and webhooks
- **Analytics** - Google Analytics 4, Mixpanel
- **CRM** - HubSpot or Salesforce integration
- **Monitoring** - Sentry error tracking, LogRocket

## User Stories

User stories are organized by integration type in their respective folders:
- Each integration has its own folder
- Stories are numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
- Stories follow standard agile format with acceptance criteria

## Integration Standards

### Security Requirements
- All API keys stored in environment variables
- OAuth tokens properly refreshed
- Rate limiting implemented
- Error handling and fallbacks

### Documentation Requirements
- Setup instructions in each integration folder
- Environment variable documentation
- Testing procedures

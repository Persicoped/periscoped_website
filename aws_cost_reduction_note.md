ðŸŽ‰ Alex the Great! 

Just found some HUGE AWS cost savings! ðŸ’°

High Impact Removals ($61.53/month savings):
- AWS Config ($32.72/month) - Compliance monitoring; overkill unless we need SOC2/HIPAA compliance
- Security Hub ($28.81/month) - Centralized security; can use CloudWatch/native monitoring instead

We can kill both of these and save $61.53/month ($738 annually) without touching our core SAAS platform! ðŸš€

Since you're in charge of DevOps - will killing these impact anything you have running? Or any compliance reason I'm missing that would need these services active? Otherwise I'm ready to axe them! âš¡
